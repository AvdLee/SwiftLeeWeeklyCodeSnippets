 The Swift Teams is on a mission: making Swift Concurrency more approachable. An upcoming change related to this mission is changing the behavior of nonisolated async functions.
 
 ### Old scenario:
 */
class NotSendable {
    func performAsync() async {
        print("Task started on thread: \(Thread.currentThread)")
    }
}

@MainActor
struct OldThreadingDemonstrator {
    
    func demonstrate() async {
        print("Starting on the main thread: \(Thread.currentThread)")
        // Prints: Starting on the main thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x6000006b4040>{number = 1, name = main}

        let notSendable = NotSendable()
        await notSendable.performAsync()
        // Prints: Task started on thread: <NSThread: 0x600003694d00>{number = 8, name = (null)}
        
        /// Returning on the main thread.
        print("Resuming on the main thread: \(Thread.currentThread)")
        // Prints: Resuming on the main thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x6000006b4040>{number = 1, name = main}
    }
}
/*:
 ### New scenario
 Note that we're not leaving the main thread anymore. The nonisolate async function inherits the caller's actor.
 */
@MainActor
struct NewThreadingDemonstrator {
    
    func demonstrate() async {
        print("Starting on the main thread: \(Thread.currentThread)")
        // Prints: Starting on the main thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x6000006b4040>{number = 1, name = main}

        let notSendable = NotSendable()
        await notSendable.performAsync()
        // Prints: Task started on thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x6000006b4040>{number = 1, name = main}
        
        /// Returning on the main thread.
        print("Resuming on the main thread: \(Thread.currentThread)")
        // Prints: Resuming on the main thread: <_NSMainThread: 0x6000006b4040>{number = 1, name = main}
    }
}

 This ensures that nonisolated functions will have consistent execution semantics by default, whether theyâ€™re sync or async.
 More detailed info about this change can be found in [SE-461](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0461-async-function-isolation.md) or by following my course at [swiftconcurrencycourse.com](https://www.swiftconcurrencycourse.com).
